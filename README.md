### Installing dependencies(MUST do BEFORE starting site)
Navigate to the project directory in a command prompt and run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies and this might take a few minutes.

### Starting a local development instance of the site
After performing the dependency install section, navigate to the project directory in a command prompt and run `npm start`. This will start a development instance of the site with extra logging, but this can cause some weird behaviour especially with charts since the site is actually rendered twice for debugging purposes. To open the site, simply type localhost:3000 into your address bar, but it should automatically open a window with the site for you. To stop, either close the command prompt window or press Ctrl + C and then type y and enter while focused on the command prompt window. 

### Starting a production instance of the site
After performing the dependency install section, navigate to the project directory in a command prompt and run `npm install -g serve`. You will only need to run this once per machine. This will globally install the serve package on your machine which allows you to serve the built site. Then run `npm run build` to create a production build of the site. Finally, run `serve -s build` to serve the built webpage and navigate again to localhost:3000 in your browser to view the page. To stop serving the build, either close the command prompt window or press Ctrl + C while in the window.
